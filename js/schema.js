Our partners will work directly with your insurance provider to help with the process of determining coverage for your GLP-1 medication, which is paid for separately from the LifeMD programs. LifeMD does not accept insurance for its GLP-1 weight loss programs, but your insurance may help cover the cost of medication. At this time, those with any form of government healthcare coverage (including programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE), whether primary or secondary, or government-related coverage such as Medicare Supplement Plans, are not eligible for LifeMD GLP-1 weight loss programs, as these plans typically do not cover the type of medication LifeMD programs may prescribe. What if my insurance doesn’t cover the medication? If for some reason your insurance will not cover the cost of your medication, you'll have the option to either pay for the medication out of pocket or cancel your LifeMD GLP-1 weight loss program membership.Given the cost of initial diagnostics, ongoing provider support, and insurance assistance, we are unable to offer refunds for previously incurred monthly membership fees."
